/* Flot plugin for showing crosshairs when the mouse hovers over the plot.

The plugin supports these options:

	crosshair: {
		mode: null or "x" or "y" or "xy"
		color: color
		lineWidth: number
		snapToDataPoint: boolean (default: false)
	}

Set the mode to one of "x", "y" or "xy". The "x" mode enables a vertical
crosshair that lets you trace the values on the x axis, "y" enables a
horizontal crosshair and "xy" enables them both. "color" is the color of the
crosshair (default is "rgba(170, 0, 0, 0.80)"), "lineWidth" is the width of
the drawn lines (default is 1), and "snapToDataPoint" (default: false) determines whether the crosshair should snap to the nearest data point.

The plugin also adds four public methods:

  - setCrosshair( pos )

    Set the position of the crosshair. Note that this is cleared if the user
    moves the mouse. "pos" is in coordinates of the plot and should be on the
    form { x: xpos, y: ypos } (you can use x2/x3/... if you're using multiple
    axes), which is coincidentally the same format as what you get from a
    "plothover" event. If "pos" is null, the crosshair is cleared.

  - clearCrosshair()

    Clear the crosshair.

  - lockCrosshair(pos)

    Cause the crosshair to lock to the current location, no longer updating if
    the user moves the mouse. Optionally supply a position (passed on to
    setCrosshair()) to move it to.

    Example usage:

	var myFlot = $.plot( $("#graph"), ..., { crosshair: { mode: "x" } } };
	$("#graph").bind( "plothover", function ( evt, position, item ) {
		if ( item ) {
